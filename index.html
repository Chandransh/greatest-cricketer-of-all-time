      <p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (born 24 April 1973) is a former Indian cricketer, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. He is the only player to have scored 100 international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the number of runs in both ODI and Test cricket, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.
      </p>
      <p>Only Sir Viv Richards stands a chance for the title against him, though with a glorious yet demanding career spanning 24 years, Sachin stands out as the greatest because of the impact on team/opposition and shear amount of runs, hundreds and fifties.

        <em>Note: The ratings are bit old. After the recorded date, Sachin bettered his performance by ~1.15 times. Hence, it is easy to say that he outperformed Viv Richards to be called as the greatest cricketer.</em>

        <h4 class="no_margin">Sachin Tendulkar V/S Viv Richards</h4>
        <p>Viv Richards holds the record as 2.19 times better batsman than his contemporaries. Sachin's value is 1.70 times the others. Apart from this Sachin has outperformed Viv's almost every batting record but average (difference 2.17) and strike rate (difference 3.97 only).</p>
        <div id="versus"></div>
        <p>
          <strong>Important: </strong>Overall, Tendulkar scored 19.24% of the total bat runs that India scored in the matches he played in his entire ODI career (18,426 runs out of 95,765). After he first opened the batting on March 27, 1994, the percentage increased to 20.08 (16,668 out of 83,008). Out of 49 centuries, 33 centuries (or ~12,000 runs) resulted in wins, most by any player.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sachin Tendulkar is also the only bowler to defend 6 or less runs in the last over of an ODI twice and has most number of Man of the Match (62) and Man of the Series (16) awards.
